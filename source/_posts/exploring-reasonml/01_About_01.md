## 原文

[Exploring ReasonML and functional programming][original]

## 关于这本书的一些问题

#### 我要学什么？

This book teaches the programming language ReasonML by Facebook.
It is also an introduction to functional programming. Especially people familiar with C-style languages (Java, JavaScript, C#, etc.) will profit from ReasonML’s familiar syntax.

#### 对读者知识有什么要求？

You should know how to program, e.g. in a mainstream language such as Java, JavaScript, C#, Python, C/C++, PHP, Ruby, Go, etc.

#### 怎么能够快速开始？

Read the whole book in order, skip chapters and sections marked as “advanced”.

#### 这本书包含所有的 ReasonML 知识吗?

This book explains the language and functional programming. It also gives tips for using the standard library.
It does not cover ReasonReact and JavaScript interop. Chapter “What to read next?” points to information on those topics.

## 这本书还没有写完

You can buy this book while it is still being written. If you do so, all future updates are included for free. For example, I will still explain ReasonML’s imperative features, including its support for object-oriented programming.

ReasonML is still evolving. What content I add to the book and when, partially depends on how the development of ReasonML progresses.
